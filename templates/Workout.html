                <h3>Why Workout is Essential for Mental Health</h3>
                <p>Regular exercise is one of the most powerful tools for mental wellness. Physical activity triggers the release of endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine - natural mood elevators that combat depression and anxiety. Exercise also increases BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), promoting new brain connections and improving cognitive function. It reduces stress hormones like cortisol, improves sleep quality, and builds self-confidence through achievement of fitness goals.</p>
